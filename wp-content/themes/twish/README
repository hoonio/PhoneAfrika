## HTML 5 Validation Notes

WP style related validation errors:
`Element style not allowed as child of element body in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)` -- caused by wp_add_inline_style() called in adaptive_shortcodes.
`Element link is missing required attribute property.` -- All `<link>` elements are generated by wp_enqueue_script. This is a WP issue.

Native WordPress issues that don't impact functionality in supported browsers and are therefore left alone.

Vimeo oEmbed related validation errors:
`Attribute webkitallowfullscreen not allowed on element iframe at this point.`
`Attribute mozallowfullscreen not allowed on element iframe at this point.`
`The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.`

oEmbed markup is being provided by Vimeo to the WordPress `[embed]` shortcode. These validation errors don't impact functionality and are Vimeo and core WP issues.
